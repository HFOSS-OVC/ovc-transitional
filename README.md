Open Video Chat
===============

Open Video Chat is an open source video conferencing activity for the XO laptop.
This project was originally started in March 2010 with funding from the National
Technical Institute for the Deaf in Rochester NY.

The primary focus of Open Video Chat is to provide streaming video at frame rates
that are suitable for communicating with sign language. Experimentally this ends
up being somewhere between 20 and 30 frames per second.

Current Features
